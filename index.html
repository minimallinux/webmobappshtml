              <p>Web technology covers a wide area involving developing web applications for Internet or Intranet use and is
                advancing at an exponential rate, with new advances appearing almost monthly. It can range from developing
                a static single page up to large &amp; complex web apps. It enables a high speed of communication between
                you and your audience or customers. We make the best use possible of the available technology to produce
                fast and functional applications for small businesses.</p>

              <h2>IOS</h2>
              <p>iOS is the Unix-like mobile operating system which powers most of Apple's mobile devices. It is a proprietary
                software with characteristic and sometimes idiosyncratic features which are usually much liked by its devotees.
                It is one of the two dominant operating systems for mobile devices, so a fair proportion of your visitors
                will be using it. Accordingly, we take in to consideration people who may be using an iOS device when building
                a web application or site for your business and often an app may have IOS specific functionality built in.</p>

              <h2>Android</h2>
              <p>Android is an open source mobile operating system based on the Linux kernel for touchscreen mobile devices,
                such as cell phones and tablets. Users can manipulate their devices intuitively with pinching, swiping, and
                tapping. It is the most used operating system in the world today by a considerable margin and around 70%
                of your vistors will be using it. As the worlds dominant mobile OS it is extremely important to consider
                your Android users when building an application or website.</p>

              <p>Web Interfaces or User Interfaces allow effective operation and control of the device at the human end, whilst
                the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators decision-making process. With the
                increase in Mobile OS use it is now highly recommended to consider Mobile OS's in your marketing strategy
                and implementation. We take in to account these users of your application or site to provide the most effective
                and easy to use functionality for them.</p>

              <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
              <p>Many small businesses spend considerable sums on SEO for their site when often this is unnecessary. An effectively
                built application or site can increase their web presence if done correctly. Search Engines now detect a
                users device and return results for that search optimised for it, so having a mobile application or site
                alone can result in a higher ranking than many competitors, often alleviating the need for expensive SEO
                tactics. Check out our Progressive Web Application which is priced well below most SEO budgets alone!</p>

              <p>Our prime consideration when building your application is the end user. This encompasses all aspects of the
                end-user's interaction with your company, its services, and its products. The first requirement for an great
                user experience is to meet the exact needs of the customer, with minimal fuss or bother. We build your application
                with this as the primary objective.</p>

              <h2>Web Performance</h2>
              <p>Modern web pages require browsers to download upwards of 100 files for a page request. We focus primarily on
                using techniques to reduce the number, size and reccurence of files that must be downloaded to increase performance.
                Using these techniques we can decrease the time needed to view an application &amp; also reduce bandwidth
                and load on the servers.</p>

              <p>Mobile browsing, from tablets to smartphones, is growing at an unprecedented rate. Immediate gratification
                of users informational needs means effectively delivering your product via the mobile web. Mobile optimisation
                is closely aligned with user experience, especially as around eighty percent of all internet searches are

              <h2>Progressive Design</h2>
              <p>We’ve abandoned the traditional process of wireframes and Photoshop mockups. Responsive Web Design renders
                that process obsolete. You would need too many wireframes to cover all the different screen sizes available.
                We use an agile design process which is suited for designing responsive patterns. It allows us to focus on
                small pieces of a design and build upon them quickly.</p>

              Javascript is a high level object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is known as the scripting language for
              Web pages and has become one of the the widest used programming lamguages today. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm
              scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
              With a huge number of libraries available it is a near certainty that it will be used to enhance your app or
              site's funtionality.

              Express JS is one of the fastest growing web frameworks and many popular web companies like Koding and Prismatic are using
              it in their enterprises. Express.js and Node.js have given JavaScript a back-end functionality, allowing developers
              to build software with JavaScript on the server side. It has a powerful middleware and routing functionality
              to aid devleopment of complex applications and capabilties to build a wide range of applications from a single
              page to Hybrid Mobile app.

              Node.js is a development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side. Node is useful for applications that require
              a persistent connection from the browser to the server and is often used for real-time applications such as
              news feeds and web push notifications. It has a single threaded, event based non-blocking I/O model that makes
              it lightweight and efficient. It has a huge range and in fact NPM is the largest system of open source libraries
              in the world.

              Frameworks are used for building Hybrid Mobile apps or Web apps with iOS and Android native functionality. We concentrate
              on these as they are the two dominant OS for mobile, powering almost 98% of all devices. There are a large
              choice of frameworks available and many of the ones available can be used alongside Apache Cordova to build
              Mobile Apps for your business with a native look and feel. We use these or React Native to produce fast and
              functional Hybrid Mobile apps or websites.

            <p>Apache Cordova is a Hybrid Mobile development environment that is used to generate iOS and Android mobile apps.
              It enables wrapping up of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript code and extends the features of HTML and JavaScript to
              work with the device. This means that code can be written once and run on multiple devices so it is not necessary
              to use native Java or Swift code. The performance tradeoff is minimal in comparison to the productivity gains.
              The resulting applications perform very exceptionally well on both iOS and Android devices. </p>

            <p>Bootstrap is a web framework for designing front end websites and web applications. It contains grid based mobile
              responsive components for forms, buttons, navigation, cards, modals and others as well as JavaScript extensions.
              With legacy browser support and large library, its a good choice if you are short on time although care is
              needed if target users have slow and expensive broadband. The latest incarnation has dropped support for older
              browsers although version 3 can still be used if necessary.

            <p>Materialize is a UI component library created with CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. The UI components help to construct
              attractive, consistent, and functional web pages and web apps, while adhering to modern web design principles

            <p>
              CSS Grid is a method designed for the two-dimensional layout of items on a webpage or application. It excels at dividing
              a page into major regions, or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts
              of a control built from HTML primitives. Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into
              columns and rows. However, many more layouts are either possible or easier with CSS grid than they were with
              tables. For example, a grid container's child elements could position themselves so they actually overlap and
              layer, similar to CSS positioned elements.

              Vue JS is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from
              the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy
              to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. Additionally, Vue is perfectly capable
              of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting
              libraries. Vue JS utilizes a virtual DOM and provides reactive and composable view components. Routing and
              global state management is handled by companion libraries.

            <p>React Native is a modern framework that allows JavaScript to run on and interact with IOS and Android phones
              in the same way as native code does but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms. Web
              developers can now write mobile applications that look and feel truly “native,” from the comfort of a JavaScript
              library that we already know. As most of the code written can be shared between platforms, it makes it easy
              to simultaneously develop for both Android and iOS. This dynamic and powerful framework is enabling a host
              of opportunities for organisations that want to consolidate down their application architectures, and take
              a ‘write once deploy anywhere’ approach to application development for devices.</p>

            <p>Opa is an open-source programming language for developing scalable web applications. It can be used for both
              client-side and server-side scripting, where complete programs are written in Opa and subsequently compiled
              to Nodejs on the server and JavaScript on the client, with the compiler automating all communication between
              the two. Opa implements strong, static typing, which helps in protecting against security issues such as SQL
              injections and scripting attacks. Opa is functional and has a static type system with type inference. Opa provides
              many structures or functions that are common in web development, as first-class objects, for instance HTML
              and parsers.</p>

              can be combined with each other. Components are divided into different compartments according to their purpose
              and functionality. The end result is code which is clean, light-weight, functional and feature rich.

              and documented. WordPress is a very flexible web application framework and is the most popular website management
              system in the world, powering more than 60 million websites. We typically use a starter like Roots Sage with
              Laravel (Blade) to build from the ground up rapidly.

              with additional routing and controllers. Other tools include Yarn, NPM, Webpack and Composer. Any CSS Framework
              can be used or none at all, and many different Javascript libraries as suits the project. It enables the building
              of fast and lightweight Wordpress sites without using themes which are often bloated and oversize.</p>

              application functionality. It combines the best aspects of other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented
              in other languages. It is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications.</p>
